Terms of Service — Love & Flirty Quiz

Last updated: 12 Sep 2025

Welcome to Love & Flirty Quiz (“the App”, “we”, “our”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms of Service.

The App is developed and published by QuizFans Studio.



1. Eligibility & Content

The App is designed for users aged 13 and older.

The App contains light, non-explicit flirting content, for entertainment purposes only.

If you are under 13, you may not use the App. If you are between 13–17, you should use the App under parental guidance.

Do not use the App in jurisdictions where its use is prohibited.




2. License

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes only.



3. Purchases & Premium

Some features (e.g., Premium Pack) require a one-time payment via Google Play Billing.

The Premium Pack unlocks **20 exclusive levels** in addition to the Standard content.  

The Premium Pack removes all advertising (no banners, no interstitial ads).  

Premium Pack is a **non-consumable purchase**, meaning it is permanently linked to the Google account used for the purchase.  

If you reinstall the App or change devices, you can restore your Premium purchase at no extra cost by using the **“Restore Purchases”** option in the App menu.  

All purchases are processed securely by Google Play; Google’s terms, privacy policies, and applicable tax rules apply.  



4. Advertising

The Standard Pack of the App may display advertising (Google AdMob or similar).

Premium Pack is ad-free.

You can control personalized ads via your device or Google account settings.




5. User Conduct

You agree not to:

Misuse or interfere with the App.

Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or hack the App.

Use the App in ways that violate applicable laws or harm others.




6. Intellectual Property

All content (questions, texts, design, graphics, code) belongs to QuizFans Studio or its licensors.

You may not copy, reproduce, or redistribute the App or its content without written permission.




7. Disclaimers

The App is provided “AS IS”, without warranties of any kind.

We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, error-free operation, or specific results.




8. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, QuizFans Studio is not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from your use of the App.



9. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms.

You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.
