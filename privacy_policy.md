However, certain **third-party SDKs** integrated into the App may automatically collect limited technical information:

- **Advertising identifiers and analytics data** – to serve and measure ads (via **Liftoff Monetize SDK**, formerly Vungle, and **Firebase Analytics**).

- **Purchase tokens** – processed securely by **Google Play Billing** when unlocking Premium content.  

No sensitive categories of data (e.g., health, political, biometric, religious, or sexual orientation) are collected.  
No data is ever linked to a specific identity.

## How We Use Data
We use the data strictly for:
- Delivering app functionality (levels, scoring, rewards, Premium unlocks)  
- Analytics and crash diagnostics to improve stability and performance  
- Displaying and measuring **in-app advertisements** (Standard Pack, Daily Bonus, Rewarded Ads)
